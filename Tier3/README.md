# chinguV12_prework

This is a pre-work project idea for Chingu Voyage 12. This is a functional quasi-clone of Google Fonts.

The project is [deployed here](https://github.com/johnmeade-webdev/chinguV12_prework).

**Tier 1**: Implement the basic design layout with information hardcoded. The custom text and reset button should work. All information is hardcoded. HTML/CSS/JS ONLY. Project should be stored and deployed on github. 
*Extra Features: implement the dark/light mode, implement the grid/list view mode, make page responsive, implement the back to top button.*

**Tier 2**: Tier 1 + Responsiveness and the Back to Top Button (you'll need it!). Develop the font cards via the Google Fonts API using the 8 highest trending fonts at that moment. Implement the search feature. Frameworks can be used. Project should be stored on github and deployed as a functional app. 
*Extra Features: implement the dark/light mode, implement the grid/list view mode, implement lazy-loading.*

**Tier 3**: Tier 2 + Add a user login that offers a dashboard with the user's favorite fonts. Fonts can be added or removed with the plus/minus button on each font-card. This feature should be enacted with back-end persistance (vs. localStorage, Cache API, etc). Frameworks can be used. Project should be stored on github and deployed as a functional app. 
**Extra Features: implement the dark/light mode, implement the grid/list view mode, implement lazy-loading, give font use information with some data visualization*

# API Information

This project uses the free [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). Make sure you read the API docs and understand how your information will be requested and delivered. Tier 1 will simply hardcode the font-cards as shown in the example. Tier 2 can store their API Key in the JS file; Tier 3 should follow standard protocol and make sure the API Key is hidden.
